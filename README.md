To start create 2 terminals that happen in the frontend and backend (cd to respective folders once you open terminal)

Also create port 5000 and set its visibility to public (will find a fix on this later)
Make sure that the backendUrl in app.jsx (frontend) matches with the current port local address (will find a permanent
fix later but i had to input it manually since i was using github Codespaces)

Terminal 1 (backend)
enter "python app.py" into the terminal
ignore the error that's going on there and I'll look into it later

Terminal 2 (frontend)
enter "npm run dev" into the terminal
